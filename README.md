## Project Description 
Application that displays information about different fish.

## Link to the API you plan to use
https://www.fishwatch.gov/api/species

API provides a ton of information.

## Example data response you plan to use
```json

Availability: "<p>Year-round.</p> ",
Biology: "<ul> <li>White hake can grow up to 53 inches and weigh up to 49 pounds.</li> <li>White hake eggs are buoyant, and larval and early juvenile fish live higher in the water column than adult fish.</li> <li>White hake settle to the bottom when they are about 2 months old.</li> <li>Adult white hake typically prefer deeper water than juveniles.</li> <li>White hake move inshore to shallower waters in the summer and move offshore to deeper waters during the winter.</li> <li>Male white hake are usually smaller than females.</li> <li>Adult white hake primarily prey on other bottom-dwelling organisms, such as squid, crustaceans, and small bony fish.</li> </ul> ",

Harvest: "<ul> <li>Commercial fishery: <ul> <li>In 2019, commercial landings of white hake totaled more than 4.3 million pounds&nbsp;and were valued at over $4.6 million, according to the NOAA Fisheries <a href="https://foss.nmfs.noaa.gov/apexfoss/f?p=215:200::::::">commercial fishing landings database</a>.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Gear types, habitat impacts, and bycatch: <ul> <li>White hake are commonly harvested using trawl nets, gillnets, bottom longlines, and rod and reel.</li> <li>Gillnets, longlines, and rod and reel used to harvest white hake have little to no impact on habitat.&nbsp;</li> <li>Closed areas and gear restrictions reduce habitat impacts from trawl nets.&nbsp;</li> <li>Fishermen follow management measures designed to reduce interactions with marine mammals, including gear modifications, seasonsal closures, and use of marine mammal deterrents.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Recreational fishery: <ul> <li>White hake are encountered by recreational fishermen fishing with hook-and-line. Fishing occurs year round.&nbsp;</li> <li>There is no minimum fish size limit for white hake, and the recreational bag limit is unlimited.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> ",

Human Health: null,
Physical Description: "<ul> <li>White hake have a large mouth that extends back below their eyes.</li> <li>White hake have one anal fin and two dorsal fins. The first dorsal fin is tall and triangular, and the second is lower, rounded, and extends almost to the fishâ€™s tail.</li> <li>The third fin ray on the first (triangular) dorsal fin is elongated and extends much higher than the rest of the fin.</li> <li>White hake are a member of the cod order and have a barbel (whisker) on their chin.</li> <li>White hake vary in color; most adults range from purplish-brown to golden-brown on their back and sides, and they have a yellowish-white belly speckled with small black spots.</li> </ul> ",

Quote: "Although populations are below target levels, U.S. wild-caught white hake is still a smart seafood choice because it is sustainably managed under a rebuilding plan that allows limited harvest under U.S. regulations.",

## Visual of your component hierarchy

Comp

-Header >displays the search for fish or the option to select a random button that.

- Fish > Fish info that I will be requesting as seen below in user stories.

-  Fish card > cards of the most commonly caught fish (bass, sunfish, catfish, salmon, rainbow trout, cod, croppie, ect.) This will be displayed at the "Home"

- Random fish > utilizes a random button to return information about a random fish.

## User Stories

I want the user to be able to access commonly caught fish.
I want the user to be able to access information regarding a fish of their choice.
I want the user to be able to learn about random fish if they choose to do so.
I want users to be able to learn about a fish's Name, Health Benefits, Biology, Physical description, harvest type, taste, location, and display image of fish if listed from API.

### MVP Goals
Format the application for where information will be displayed and how with API information.
Test functionality and make corrections if needed.
Successfully deploy the application via GitHub.
 


### Stretch Goals
Create a "nutrition label" of the fish when consumed.
Create a logo.
